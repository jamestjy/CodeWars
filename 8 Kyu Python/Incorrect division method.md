# Incorrect division method

This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument by its second, isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.

# Given Code

```{python}
def divide_numbers(x,y):
    return x // y
```

# My Solution

```{python}
def divide_numbers(x,y):
    return x / y
```
