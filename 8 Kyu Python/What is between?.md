# What is between?

Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:
```
a = 1
b = 4
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

# Given Code

```{python}
def between(a,b):
    # good luck
    pass
```

# My Solution

```{python}
def between(a,b):
    # good luck
    return list(range(a, b+1))
```
