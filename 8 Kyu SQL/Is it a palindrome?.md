# Is it a palindrome?

Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that 
reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date and 
time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".

## Given Code
```
-- # write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'ispalindrome' with column 'str', return a table with column 'str' and your result in a column named 'res'.
```

## My Solution
